      <h1>The services I provide include:</h1>
      <p>
        A frontend developer is a type of software developer who specializes in
        creating and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience
        (UX) of websites and applications. I work on the client-side of software
        development, which means I am responsible for what the user sees and
        interacts with in their browser or on their mobile device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frontend developers typically work with web technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks and libraries such as React,
        Angular, and Vue. They are also responsible for ensuring that the
        website or application is responsive and accessible across different
        devices and browsers.
      </p>
      <h2>Here are examples of what I do.</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Design implementation</h3>
      <p>
        I work with a design team to implement the visual design of a website or
        application. This involves creating the layout of the page, choosing
        appropriate typography and colors, and ensuring that the design is
        consistent across different pages.
      </p>
      <h3>Responsive designs:</h3>
      <p>
        With the increase in mobile and tablet use, frontend developers need to
        ensure that the website or application is responsive, meaning it adjusts
        to different screen sizes. This may involve using media queries in CSS
        to adjust the layout, or using a responsive framework such as Bootstrap.
      </p>
      <h3>Interactive features:</h3>
      <p>
        Frontend developers are responsible for adding interactivity to the
        website or application. This may include creating forms for users to
        input information, adding animations, or creating interactive maps or
        charts.
      </p>
      <h3>Performance optimization:</h3>
      <p>
        As a frontend developer, I need to ensure that the website or
        application loads quickly and performs well. This may involve optimizing
        images and other assets, minimizing the number of HTTP requests, and
        using techniques such as lazy loading to improve performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility:</h3>
      <p>
        I work to ensure that the website or application is accessible to users
        with disabilities. This may involve using ARIA attributes to make the
        site more navigable for screen readers, ensuring that the color contrast
        is sufficient, and testing the site with assistive technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, a frontend developer plays a critical role in ensuring that the
        website or application is easy to use, visually appealing, and performs
        well across different devices and browsers.
